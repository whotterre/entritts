# Entritts
Entritts is a ticket reservation/ event management backend system.
It uses the microservices architecture and is written with:
-  Fiber (Super fast web framework written in Go).
-  RabbitMQ (Message queue to enable communication between services and decoupling).
-  PostgreSQL( Consistency + Availability matter in this system).
-  Amazon S3 or Cloudinary for object storage.
-  GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
I aim to use this to learn more about microservices architecture, distributed systems and
patterns in building them, and RabbitMQ as well.
